# BugTracker App

I'm making a MERN fullstack app to track my projects and bugs
Using React typescript and no component library, I'm making my own using StyledComponents

The backend to this project is on [my other repo](https://github.com/St-Creamer/bugtracker-rest) 

It is still under construction 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
