# BugTracker App

I'm making a [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) fullstack app to track my projects and bugs
Using React typescript and no component library, I'm making my own components using [StyledComponents](https://styled-components.com)

The backend to this project is on [my other repo](https://github.com/St-Creamer/bugtracker-rest) 

It is still under construction but here is a sneak peek at an early design using [Figma](https://www.figma.com):

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
